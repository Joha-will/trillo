    2. The main idea behind FlexBox is to give the container the ability to expand and shrink elements to best use the available space;
    3. Flexbox replaces float layout, using less with more readable and logical code;
    4. Flexbox completely changes the way that we build one-dimensional layouts;
    5. It is a true revolution in CSS;
